            <h2>Jennifer Lopez</h2>
            <p>
                danced on the TV show In Living Color before her starring 
                role in the film Selena. She turned to music and found major success on 
                the pop and dance charts with hits like "Get Right" and "Play," while 
                continuing to garner Hollywood film work. She married salsa icon Marc 
                Anthony in 2004 and had twins; the couple split a few years later. Her 
                recent TV projects include American Idol, Shades of Blue and World of 
                Dance.

                Early Life and Career
                Born July 24, 1969, in the Bronx, New York, Lopez began her career as a 
                dancer, appearing in stage musicals and various music videos. In 1990, 
                she won a national competition and earned a spot dancing on the popular 
                Fox comedy television series In Living Color as one of the "Fly Girls." 
                A series of small acting jobs followed, including parts in two more series 
                and a TV movie, Nurses on the Line: The Crash of Flight 7, in 1993.

                Early in 2000, Lopez was nominated for Best Dance Performance for her 
                second hit single "Waiting For Tonight," but lost the award to Cher. In 
                the summer of 2000, she starred in the science fiction-thriller The Cell, 
                in which she plays a child psychologist helping to track a terrifying serial 
                killer. The same year, she starred in Enough, a portrayal of spousal abuse.
                The popularity of the multi-talented Lopez reached new heights in early 2001, 
                when her album J. Lo debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts, while her film, the 
                romantic comedy The Wedding Planner, shot to the top spot at the box office in 
                its first week of release. In December 2002, she delivered another one-two punch 
                with the release of the record This Is Me ... Then and a starring role in the 
                comedy Maid in Manhattan, which was a box office hit, if not a critical one.

                See I know a little bit something good
                Always comes out of a little bit something bad
                And I wasn't looking for someone new
                Till you came down
                Giving me the best the time I've had
                And now you're on my skin

                Round after round woah oh oh oh

                'Cause if you were my first
                Baby there wouldn't have been
                No second, third or fourth love
                Mistakes I don't worry 'bout them no more
                It ain't no thing
                'Cause you got me, I'm on Cloud 9
                So good, no I cannot just keep it real
                T-shirt and jeans
